For a given code snippet, you are to give me the PLAN of STEP BY STEP execution of the given code snippet. 

I will give you a few examples where for a given code snippet, I will show you to predict the step by step procedure of program execution that you need to follow when predicting the code coverage
Do not answer unless instructed to do so
Example #1- 
Code snippet : 
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
result = num1 * num2 
print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))
PLAN: 
Step 1 : Variable Initialization: Set num1 to 5. Set num2 to 7. "num1 = 5" and "num2 = 7" will be executed.
Step 2: Operation: Multiply num1 and num2 and Store the result in the variable result. "result = num1 * num2 " will be executed.
Step 3: Display Result: Use the print function to display a formatted string. "print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))" will be executed

So the final code coverage will be :
> num1 = 5
> num2 = 7
> result = num1 * num2 
> print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, result))

Example 2 - 
Code snippet : 
number = 15
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

PLAN : 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize the number variable with a specific value. In this case, it's set to 15. "number = 15" will be executed.
Step 2: Operation : Use the % (modulo) operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.If the result is 0, the number is even. If not, it's odd. 
Step 3: Branching if-else Block: Enter the if block if the number is even. Since 15%2 results in 1, Line 3 will not be executed but the else block if the number is odd. Statements "if number % 2 == 0:", "else:" and "print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))" will be executed.
Step 4: Output: The required print statement will be executed based on the output of the if-else block
So the final code coverage will be : 
> number = 15
> if number % 2 == 0:
!     print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
> else:
>     print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

Example 3 - 
Code Snippet : 
val = 5
for i in range(val):
    print("Current number:", i)
print("Loop completed!")
PLAN: 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize variable 'val' to 5. "val = 5" will be executed
Step 2: For Loop Execution: Enter the for loop and iteratively assigne values to 'i' from 0 to val-1. Inside the for loop, Print the current value of i in each iteration."for i in range(val):" and "print("Current number:", i)" will be executed. 
Step 3: For Loop Exit: Exit the for loop after 'i' reaches the max limit val-1. Execute the code after the loop which is a print statement. "print("Loop completed!")" will be executed. 
So the final code coverage will be :
> val = 5
> for i in range(val):
>     print("Current number:", i)
> print("Loop completed!")

Example 4- 
Code Snippet : 
start_range = 3
end_range = 6
for i in range(start_range, end_range):
    print("Checking number:", i)
    if i == 2:
        print("2")  # Do nothing for even numbers
    else:
        print("Not 2")

PLAN: 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: start_range and end_range are variables initialized to 1 and 6 respectively. Lines "start_range = 3" and "end_range = 6" will be executed. 
Step 2: For Loop Execution: Enter the for loop and Iteratively assign values to i from start_range to end_range - 1. "for i in range(start_range, end_range):" will be executed.
Print the current value of i. "print("Checking number:", i)" will be executed. 
Step 3: Branching if-else block: Enter the if block if 'i' is equal to 2, print 2. else, print "Not 2". As the for loop is iterated over, since none of the numbers are equal to 2, The if statement will never be true. "if i == 2:" will be executed but "print("2")" will not be executed. "else:" and "print("Not 2")" will be executed. 
Step 4: For Loop Exit: Exit the for loop after 'i' reaches the max limit end_range-1.
So the final code coverage will be: 
> start_range = 3
> end_range = 6
> for i in range(start_range, end_range):
>     print("Checking number:", i)
>     if i == 2:
!         print("2")  # Do nothing for even numbers
>     else:
>         print("Not 2")


Example 5 - 
Code Snippet: 
def calculate_square(number):	
    return number ** 2	
def calculate_cube(number):	
    return number ** 3	
def display_results(number, square, cube):	
    print("Number: {}".format(number))	
    print("Square: {}".format(square))	
    print("Cube: {}".format(cube))	
def main():	
    user_number = 2	
    square_result = calculate_square(user_number)
    cube_result = calculate_cube(user_number)
    display_results(user_number, square_result, cube_result)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

PLAN : 
Step 1: Check __name__ : Check if the script is being run as a main program. Since it is, "if __name__ == "__main__":"  will be executed. 
Step 2: Main method call: Since the script is being run as the main program, call the main method. "main()" will be executed
Step 3: Main Method Execution: Contents inside mthod will be executed. "def main():" will be executed. Since "user_number = 2" is a variable initialization, it will be executed. 
Step 4: Method Calls with main function:  calculate_square method with user_number as an argument. So, "square_result = calculate_square(user_number)" wil be executed. calculate_cube method with user_number as an argument. So, "cube_result = calculate_cube(user_number)" wil be executed. Also,  display_result method with user_number and the result from calculate_square and calculate_cube as arguments. "display_results(user_number, square_result, cube_result)" will be executed.
Step 5: Called Method executions : Inside calculate_square method, the squared value of user_number is returned to the main method.The value returned is 4. Statements "def calculate_square(number):" and "return number ** 2" are executed. 
Step 6: Called Method executions : Inside calculate_cube method, the cubed value of user_number is returned to the main method. The value returned is 8. "def calculate_cube(number):" and "return number ** 3" are executed.
Step 7: Called Method executions : Inside display_result, the user_number, the value returned by the calculated_square method which is 4 and the value returned by calculate_cube method whoch is 8. So, Lines "def display_results(number, square, cube):	", "print("Number: {}".format(number))", "print("Square: {}".format(square))" and "print("Cube: {}".format(cube))" will be executed. 
So the final code coverage will be: 
> def calculate_square(number):	
>     return number ** 2	
> def calculate_cube(number):	
>     return number ** 3	
> def display_results(number, square, cube):	
>     print("Number: {}".format(number))	
>     print("Square: {}".format(square))	
>     print("Cube: {}".format(cube))	
> def main():	
>     user_number = 2	
>     square_result = calculate_square(user_number)
>     cube_result = calculate_cube(user_number)
>     display_results(user_number, square_result, cube_result)
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()


Example6 - 
Code Snippet : 
def calculate_and_display_results(number): 	
    square_result = number ** 2	
    cube_result = number ** 3	
    print("Number: {}".format(number))	
    print("Square: {}".format(square_result))	
    print("Cube: {}".format(cube_result))	
    print("--------------------")  	
def get_user_input(): 
    return int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
def main():		
    num_iterations = 3	
    for i in range(num_iterations):	
        user_number = get_user_input()	
        calculate_and_display_results(user_number)	
if __name__ == "__main__":	
    main()

PLAN: 
Step 1: Check __name__ : Check if the script is being run as a main program. "if __name__ == "__main__":"5 will be executed. 
Step 2: Main method call: Since the script is being run as the main program, call the main method. "main()" will be executed
Step 3: Main Method Execution: Contents inside method will be executed. "def main():" will be executed. Since "num_iterations = 3" is a variable initialization where num_iterations is set to 3, it wll be executed. 
Step 4: For loop in Main Function:  Enter the for loop and Iteratively assign values to i from 1 to num_iterations - 1. "for i in range(num_iterations):" will be executed. get_user_input method is called and the return value is assigned to variable user_number. After that, calculate_and_display_results() method is called wuth user_number as a parameter. "user_number = get_user_input()" and "calculate_and_display_results(user_number)" are executed. 
Step 5: Called Method executions: the get_user_input() method gets an integer input from the user and returns it to the main function. So, "def get_user_input():" and "return int(input("Enter a number: "))" are executed. 
Step 6: Called Method executions: Inside the calculate_and_display_results() method, the square and cube of the number accepted from the user are calculates. The user_input, its square and its cuvbe are the printed. a seperator is then displayed to increase readability. So, "def calculate_and_display_results(number):", "square_result = number ** 2", "cube_result = number ** 3", "print("Number: {}".format(number))", "print("Square: {}".format(square_result))", "print("Cube: {}".format(cube_result))" and "print("--------------------")" are executed.

Example 7 - 
Code Snippet :
def check_even_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "even"
    else:
        return "odd"
def display_result(number, result):
    print("The number {} is {}.".format(number, result))
def main():
    user_number = 6
    result = check_even_odd(user_number)
    display_result(user_number, result)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

PLAN : 
Step 1: Check __name__ : Check if the script is being run as a main program. Since it is, "if __name__ == "__main__":" will be executed. 
Step 2: Main method call: Since the script is being run as the main program, call the main method. "main()" will be executed
Step 3: Main Method Execution: Contents inside mthod will be executed. "def main():" will be executed. Since "user_number = 6" is a variable initialization, it wll be executed. 
Step 4: Method Calls with main function:  check_even_odd method with user_number as an argument. Also,  display_result method with user_number and the result from check_even_odd as arguments. "result = check_even_odd(user_number)" and "display_result(user_number, result)" will be executed
Step 5: Called Method executions : Inside check_even_odd, check if the given number is even or odd. since user_number is even "even" output will be returned to the main mathod through the call and the else block will not be executed. "def check_even_odd(number):", "if number % 2 == 0:" and "return "even"" will be executed. "else:" and "return "odd"" will not be executed. 
Step 6: Called Methos executions : Inside display_result, print a message indicating whether the number is even or odd. "def display_result(number, result):" and "print("The number {} is {}.".format(number, result))" will be executed. 
So the code coverage of the given code snippet is-

Example 8 - 
Code Snippet: 
def check_even_odd(number): 
    if number % 2 == 0: 
        return "even" 
    else: 
        return "odd" 
def display_results(number, result):

        if result == "even": 
            print("It's an even number!") 
        else: 
            print("It's an odd number!") 
        display_results(user_number, result) 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    main() 

PLAN: 
Step 1: Check __name__ : Check if the script is being run as a main program. Since it is, "if __name__ == "__main__":" will be executed. 
Step 2: Main method call: Since the script is being run as the main program, call the main method. "main()" will be executed
Step 3: Main Method Execution: Contents inside mthod will be executed. "def main():" will be executed. Since "num_iterations = 3" is a variable initialization, it wll be executed. 
Step 4: For loop in Main Function:  Enter the for loop and Iteratively assign values to i from 1 to num_iterations - 1. "result = check_even_odd(user_number)" will be executed. Since "if result == "even":" within the for loop is a variable initialization, it will be executed. Line 17 is a method call to check_even_odd() method and the value returned by the function is assigned to the variable 'result'. Line 15 will be executed. Finally "display_results(user_number, result)" will be executed which is a function call for displaying the results obtained. 
Step 5: Called Method executions : Inside check_even_odd, check if the given number is even or odd. since user_number is even "even" output will be returned to the main mathod through the call and the else block will not be executed. lines 1, 2 and 3 will 
Step 6: If-else block withing for loop in main method: The if statement checks whether the result obtained from the check_even_odd function is odd or even. for all 3 iterations, the 'result' will be 'even' since user_number is 4 which is an even number, only the if block will be executed. "if result == "even":" and "print("It's an even number!")" will be executed. 
Step 7: Called Method executions: Inside display_results, The original number will be displayed and the result of whether it is odd or even will be displayed. After this, a seperator will be printed to increase readabilty.So, "def display_results(number, result):", "print("Number: {}".format(number))", "print("Result: {}".format(result))" and "print("--------------------")" will be executed. 
So the final code coverage will be : 
> def check_even_odd(number):
>     if number % 2 == 0:
>         return "even"
!     else:
!         return "odd"
> def display_result(number, result):
