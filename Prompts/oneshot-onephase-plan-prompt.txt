For the given code snippet, Predict the code coverage. The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been executed or not. 
> if the line is executed
! if the line is not executed

Example output:
> line1
! line2
> line3
...
> linen

You need to develop a plan for step by step execution of the code snippet. 
Below is an illustration of the process you need to follow to predict the code coverage of the given code snippet. 

Example - 
Given Code snippet : 
from math import factorial
def comb(n, r):
    return factorial(n)
def main():
    N = 2
    P = 0
    A = [1, 3]
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
        else:
            odd += 1
    a, b = 0, 0
    b = 2**even
    for i in range(odd + 1):
        if i % 2 == P:
            a += comb(odd, i)
    print(a * b)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
DISCLAIMER: Lines that are not executed are to be denoted with a SINGLE '!' whereas lines that are executed are to be denoted with a single '>'
Given 
PLAN: 
Step 1: Import Statement : factorial is a packahe being imported from math library. Import statements are always executed. Statement "from math import factorial" will ne executed.
Step 2: Check __name__ : Check if the script is being run as a main program. Since it is, "if __name__ == "__main__": " will be executed. 
Step 3: Main method call: Since the script is being run as the main program, call the main method. "main()" will be executed
Step 4: Main Method Execution: Contents inside mthod will be executed. "def main(): " will be executed. Since "N = 2", "P = 0", "A = [1, 3]" and "even, odd = 0, 0" are all variable initialization statements, they will be executed. 
Step 5: First For loop in Main Function:  Enter the for loop and Iteratively assign values to i from 1 to range(N). "for i in range(N):"  will be executed. 
Step 6: If - Else Branching in For Loop: For each iteration of i, the element at A[i] is checked if its even or odd. Both elements in list A are odd, so the if statement is not satisfied and the else statement is satisfied so contents of else block is executed. Statements "if A[i] % 2 != 0:" and "odd += 1" are executed. Statements "else: " and "even += 1" is not executed. 
Step 7: Variable initialization and Math operations : Statements "a, b = 0, 0" and "b = 2**even" are variable declarations so they both will be executed. 
Step 8: Second For Loop in Main Function : Enter the for loop and Iteratively assign values to i from 1 to range(odd + 1). "for i in range(odd + 1):"  will be executed. 
Step 9: If-else block withing for loop in main method: The if statement checks whether the remainder of variable i when divided by 2 is equal to value of P. Since the value of i in the second iteration is 2, the remainder is 0 which is equal to P, so the if condition is satisifed. Statement "if i % 2 == P:" is executed
Step 10: Method call in if block of for loop: When the if statement is satisfied, the variable a is incremented with the value return by method comb. Since it is a function call, statement "a += comb(odd, i)" will be executed.
Step 11: Called Method execution: Inside comb(), The math operation of calculating the factorial occurs. Since its a simple math operation and return statement, statement "return factorial(n)" will be executed. The statement containing the method declaration "def comb(n, r): " will also be executed.
Step 12: Print Statement: Print statements are always executed. Statement "print(a * b)" will be executed. 

So the code coverage for the given code snippet will be: 
from math import factorial
> def comb(n, r):
>     return factorial(n)
> def main():
>     N = 2
>     P = 0
>     A = [1, 3]
>     even, odd = 0, 0
>     for i in range(N):
>         if A[i] % 2 != 0:
>             odd += 1
!         else:
!             even += 1
>     a, b = 0, 0
>     b = 2**even
>     for i in range(odd + 1):
>         if i % 2 == P:
>             a += comb(odd, i)
>     print(a * b)
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()
