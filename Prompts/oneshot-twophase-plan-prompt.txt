For the given code snippet, give the plan to predict the code coverage. The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been executed or not. 

You need to develop a plan for step by step execution of the code snippet. 
Below is an illustration of the process you need to follow to predict the code coverage of the given code snippet. 

Example - 
Given Code snippet : 
number = 15
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

PLAN : 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize the number variable with a specific value. In this case, it's set to 15. Statements "number = 15" will be executed. "if number % 2 == 0:" will be executed
Step 2: Operation : Use the % (modulo) operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.If the result is 0, the number is even. If not, it's odd.
Step 3: Branching if-else Block: Enter the if block if the number is even. Since 15%2 results in 1, statement "print("{} is an even number.".format(number))" will not be executed but the else block if the number is odd. Statements "else:" and "print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))" will be executed
Step 4: Output: The required print statement will be executed based on the output of the if-else block


In a similar fashion, develop a plan of step by step execution of the below code snippet -
