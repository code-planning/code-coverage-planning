For the given code snippet and plan, give the code coverage that follows the plan. The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been executed or not. 
> if the line is executed
! if the line is not executed
Example output:
> line1
! line2
> line3
...
> linen
You need to give the code with its coverage for the given plan.
DISCLAIMER: Lines that are not executed are to be denoted with a SINGLE '!' whereas lines that are executed are to be denoted with a single '>'
Below is an illustration of the process you need to follow to predict the code coverage of the given code snippet and its plan. 
Given Code snippet : 
number = 15
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))

PLAN : 
Step 1: Variable Initialization: Initialize the number variable with a specific value. In this case, it's set to 15. Statements "number = 15" will be executed. "if number % 2 == 0:" will be executed
Step 2: Operation : Use the % (modulo) operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.If the result is 0, the number is even. If not, it's odd.
Step 3: Branching if-else Block: Enter the if block if the number is even. Since 15%2 results in 1, statement "print("{} is an even number.".format(number))" will not be executed but the else block if the number is odd. Statements "else:" and "print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))" will be executed
Step 4: Output: The required print statement will be executed based on the output of the if-else block
So the final code coverage will be : 

> number = 15
> if number % 2 == 0:
!     print("{} is an even number.".format(number))
> else:
>     print("{} is an odd number.".format(number))


In a similar fashion, Give the code coverage of the below code snippet -
